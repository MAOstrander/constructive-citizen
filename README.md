# Denizen to Citizen
### Become more informed and active in your government!

## About
This is serves as an access portal for someone of little to no political knowledge to get started on being a constructive citizen. It'll let someone know the basics of how the government works, how they fit into the picture, and highlight resources they can use to further their understanding.

You can see this app in action [here](https://constructive-citizen.herokuapp.com/).
